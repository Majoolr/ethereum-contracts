Majoolr Contracts
=========================

Majoolr Contracts currently consists of token auction contracts that were [initially inspired by reddit in the wake of network congestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6iwyta/the_ico_contract_to_end_all_of_the_nonsense/ "reddit post"). All contracts are released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/Majoolr/ethereum-contracts/blob/master/LICENSE "MIT License") and are useable. [We also have an ethereum-libraries repository that currently holds deployed libraries](https://github.com/Majoolr/ethereum-libraries "Github link").

Contracts and libraries are currently written in Solidity and Solidity Assembly.

## About Us

Majoolr is hitting the ground running in becoming a valuable partner in the Ethereum community. We are not currently open for business but we are open for collaboration and seeking opportunities. [To learn more about Majoolr, our mission, as well as contributing please click here](https://majoolr.io "Majoolr website").

## How to use

Majoolr contracts are packaged independently and [utilize our libraries](https://github.com/Majoolr/ethereum-libraries "Github link") such that each contract is its own package. You will find documentation for the functions and useage instructions for development and deployment use as well.   

If you do not find what you are looking for here please let us know and be sure check out more mature libraries such as [Open-Zeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ "Zeppelin github") and see what they have.

Feedback, bug reports, library submissions, collaborations, and contributions are all welcome! We will be rewarding contributions and please do not hesitate to reach out to us.   

## Let's Collaborate!

We look forward to working with everyone and we welcome anyone that wants to collaborate. [Please visit Majoolr.io](https://majoolr.io "Majoolr website") to see more information about us and opportunities.
